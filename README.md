# FixMyRide - Project Source Code

Welcome to the source code for your FixMyRide application!

**Important:** This GitHub repository contains the code for your application, but it is not a live, running website.

To make your application accessible on the web, you need to deploy it to a hosting service. A Next.js application like this one needs a special environment to run.

### Hosting Recommendation

This project is set up and configured to work seamlessly with **Firebase App Hosting**.

To deploy your app and make it live, you should connect this GitHub repository to a Firebase App Hosting backend. Once connected, Firebase will automatically build and deploy your application whenever you push changes to your `main` branch.

### Running Locally for Development

If you want to run the app on your own computer to test changes, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, usually at `http://localhost:9002`.
